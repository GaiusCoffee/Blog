#### How Does The Tree Of Savior Class System Work?

With the [Open Beta]({{ "2016/open-beta-announcement/" | prepend: site.url }}) looming 
over the horizon, I'm sure that you and your local friendly gaming group are now in the 
midst of planning teams and guilds for [Tree of Savior](https://treeofsavior.com). There's
only three questions that needs to be answered as we make our plans for the game:

1. How does the Class System work?
2. What's their Business Model?
3. When is the Open Beta Testing going to start?

I'm going to answer the first question, and will post updates here when new information 
are available for the other two. Now, before we begin, keep in mind that most of the 
info that I have are from the Closed Beta Test (CBT) last December 2015 and INC Game's 
[Open Translate Project](https://github.com/Treeofsavior/EnglishTranslation). Some things
might have changed on launch, so please take these data with a grain of salt.

### How Many Classes Are There?

Most sites are agreeing that there are 80, while the CBT only had 28. We definitely know 
that there are **at least 44 classes**: The four basic rank ones (Swordsman, Archer, 
Wizard & Cleric), plus ten more per basic class after that (ranks two thru six). You can 
see the confirmed classes on the infographic above.

### 28? 44? 80!? That's a lot! :persevere:

Well, the system is actually simple. Here's another screenshot to make things more clear
(I know it's in korean, but trust me, It'll make sense):

That screenshot is a sample skill progression of a **Swordman 3/Rodelero 2/Centurion 1**.
Every player starts with one rank in a basic class; after they rank up, they can choose to
either: **a) choose to get a rank in one of the two new classes OR b) learn additional 
skills in their current class by taking another rank there**. When the character stays at 
the same class after ranking up, then they advance their circle on that class. Each class 
has three circles each, with at least five skills in total. 

They will get the same choice upon their next rank up, but instead of just two new classes
, there are four to choose from: the rank two classes as well as the new rank three 
classes. Of course, the player can still choose stick with their rank one class and learn 
additional skills there.

### So, in theory, you can have a Rank 6 Archer?

Unfortunately, no. Each class only has three circles each, so Archer 3 is the maximum; 
you'd have to pick a new class after that.

### I still don't understand. Can you give an example?

Sure. Let's say you start as a **Wizard 1**. You get the following skills, as a result:

* Energy Bolt (pew pew), Lethargy, Reflect Shield, Sleep

After a few levels, you finally earn enough experience to Rank Up! :fireworks: You now 
have a choice:

1. Stay being a Wizard and advance to its 2nd circle, and learn:
    * Surespell
2. OR become a Pyromancer, and learn:
    * Enchant Fire, Fire Wall, Fireball, Flame Ground, Flare
3. OR become a Cryomancer, and learn:
    * Ice Blast, Ice Bolt, Ice Pike, Ice Wall
  
It is not yet known if you can go back to learn a lower ranked skill after going up, but 
I'm going to guess that it's possible. It's also important to note that more skills is not
necessarily beneficial, due to the limited number of skill slots available to the player 
at any one time.

Anyhow, let's say our character became a **Wizard 1/Pyromancer 1**; we now have nine 
skills. You start doing more quests and eventually gain more experience to get another 
rank up. Here's your choices:

1. Stay being a Wizard by advancing to its 2nd circle, and learn:
    * Surespell
2. OR continue being a Pyromancer by advancing to its 2nd circle, and learn:
    * Fire Pillar
3. OR try being a Cryomancer, and learn:
    * Ice Blast, Ice Bolt, Ice Pike, Ice Wall
4. OR become a Psychokino, and learn:
    * Psychic Pressure, Swap, Telekinesis, Teleportation
5. OR lastly, become a Linker, and learn:
    * Hangman's Knot, Joint Penalty, Physical Link, Unbind

Take Note! This is the last time we can choose to go back as a Wizard, since that class 
started on Rank 1, and we are now in Rank 3.

That's a lot of choices; right now, our imaginary character is a **Wizard 1/Pyro 1**. 
Looking at the next Pyro skill, I don't think we're gonna need that, so let's say we 
choose to become a Cryomancer. We now have thirteen(!) skills; We plug in a controller
to make switching skill slots easier, and continue playing the game as a **Wizard 1/Pyro 
1/Cryo 1**. After a while, you rank up again:

1. Continue being a Pyromancer by advancing to its 2nd circle, and learn:
    * Fire Pillar
2. OR continue being a Cryomancer by advancing to its 2nd circle, and learn:
    * Gust, Subzero Shield
3. OR become a Psychokino, and learn:
    * Psychic Pressure, Swap, Telekinesis, Teleportation
4. OR become a Linker, and learn:
    * Hangman's Knot, Joint Penalty, Physical Link, Unbind
5. OR become a Thaumaturge, and learn:
    * Shrink Body, Swell Body, Swell Left Arm, Transpose
6. OR become a Elementalist, and learn:
    * Electrocute, Hail, Prominence, Stone Curse

Take Note! The Wizard can no longer be taken, since we are now four ranks away from it- 
the skills that it grants are now forever out of reach for our character. Also, both the
Pyromancer and the Cryomancer will be phased out next rank, since those classes started on
Rank 2, and we are now three ranks away from it at Rank 4.

The Elementalist looks nice: At Rank 4, our character ended up as **Wizard 1/Pyro 1/Cryo 1/
Elementalist 1**, with the following skills: 

* Energy Bolt (pew pew), Lethargy, Reflect Shield, Sleep
* Enchant Fire, Fire Wall, Fireball, Flame Ground, Flare
* Ice Blast, Ice Bolt, Ice Pike, Ice Wall
* Electrocute, Hail, Prominence, Stone Curse

However, we can easily have been Wizard 1/Pyro 3, or Wizard 3/Linker 1, 
with each combination having a different set of skills.

The progression of classes and skills continue onward in a similar manner.

### Conclusion

Well, it's *kind of* simple, once you get your head around the notion :sweat_smile:. 
Anyway, It doesn't matter how many classes the game would have: we would almost always 
have a reasonable number of choices, specially if you choose to specialize your character.

In the meantime, let's all hope that the Open Beta Test comes soon. I also hope that more
news are forthcoming, so that we can finally answer the looming question regarding their
business model.

Until next time: [Stay Smart, Ambitious and Competitive](http://day9.tv/manifesto).

PS: I'm thinking about creating a Skill Planner.. :neckbeard:
