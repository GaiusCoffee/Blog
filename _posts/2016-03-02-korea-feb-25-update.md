#### Two New Guild Raids, Emoticons and Player Commendation Statues

Last February 25, 2016 the Korean Test Server had a small update that added two brand new
guild raids, some new emoticons, and statues of players that reached Rank 5 on the 
northern part of the city of Klaipeda.

It's not known when this small update would deploy into english servers.

Until next time: [Stay Smart, Ambitious and Competitive](http://day9.tv/manifesto).
