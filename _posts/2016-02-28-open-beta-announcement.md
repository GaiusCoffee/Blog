#### Tree of Savior is almost here!

[Tree of Savior](https://treeofsavior.com/), a Massively Multiplayer Online RPG developed 
by IMC Games, has recently announced that they will soon be starting the Open Beta 
Testing of their game. :tada::tada::tada:

The game was made by Kim Hakkyu, the creator of Ragnarok Online, and is considered by most 
fans as the spiritual successor of the massively popular game. The game had a couple of 
very successful Closed Beta Testing that ended on December last year, with a total of more
than 300,000 registrations for it's two tests.

Unfortunately, the exact date of the Open Beta, as well as the game's release date, are 
both unconfirmed.
